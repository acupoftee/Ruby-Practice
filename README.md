<h1>ðŸ’Žâœ¨The Rub Dojo âœ¨ðŸ’Ž</h1>
</p>

Ruby is a language I've been dying to add to my toolbelt, so this repo is for Ruby problem solving practice during *General Assembly's 2019 Software Engineering Immersive* and beyond. At time of writing, we are starting our Ruby lessons so this is being done while simultaneously learning Ruby! ðŸ’ªðŸ”¥

The goals and everything for this are a total copy pasta from my [JavaScript Dojo](https://github.com/acupoftee/JS-Practice) repo since both of these languages are awesome:

* Understand nuances in Ruby problem solving. 
* Apply Ruby best practices.
* Break down complex topics with a direct and methodical approach.
* ***Explain solutions to anyone regardless of technical background.*** 

The last goal the most important goal because not only does this exemplify understanding of these concepts, it also helps make computer science more inclusive for all! ðŸ’• 

## Problems and Solutions
Problems will come from various sites like CodeWars, LeetCode, Hackerrank,Cracking the Coding Interview, and GeeksForGeeks. Each solution will describe the approach thoroughly and discuss tradeoffs and runtime. 

Feedback and discussions about the solutions and its presentation are always welcome! Feel free to open an issue with questions or comments about any problems as this will help others learn as well. Thank you for following my Ruby journey!
